	<key>Cambria Depot</key>
	<array>
		<string>Built in 1868 in the Tuscan Italianate style. 
Replaced original 1856 depot destroyed by Union soldiers in April 1865. 
One of only two remaining Reconstruction-era depots in Virginias</string>
		<string>The town of Cambria, originally known as Bangs, grew up around the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad depot, first built in 1856 about a mile away from the Christiansburg town square. Union forces under General George B. Stoneman burned the original depot and destroyed tracks during their April 1865 raid into Southwest Virginia. In 1868, a new depot was constructed in the Tuscan Italianate style. The Cambria Depot is one of only two railroad depots in Virginia built during the Reconstruction period and still standing today. In 1906, Cambria incorporated as a town (it is now part of Christiansburg) and a new passenger station was built down the tracks to the east. The old depot was converted into a freight station and became the hub for all goods shipped by rail into Montgomery and Floyd Counties for almost a hundred years, until service was discontinued in 1960. The 1868 building was restored in the 1980s.</string>

	<key>Christiansburg Institute</key>
	<array>
		<string>Founded in 1867 by Captain Charles Schaffer of the Freedmen’s Bureau as an institution to educate freed slaves. 
Booker T. Washington became adviser to the school in 1896. 
Christiansburg Institute served the educational needs of African Americans from fifteen counties until it closed in 1966</string>
		<string>Christiansburg Institute began in February 1867 with the mission of educating former slaves. The school was founded by Captain Charles S. Schaeffer, a Union soldier from Philadelphia who later became a Baptist minister. Working for the Freedmen’s Bureau, Schaeffer came to Christiansburg after the Civil War and started teaching twelve former slaves in a rented room. By 1869, the Hill School, as it was called, had grown to include over two hundred students. Beginning in 1870, a Quaker group called the Friends’ Freedmen’s Association began helping Schaeffer fund the school after the Freedmen’s Bureau stopped its support. In the 1880s Schaeffer turned over control of the school to a completely African-American staff. He retired to focus on ministry before his death in 1899. During his time in Southwest Virginia, Schaeffer organized twenty-nine African American churches. The 1885 Hill School and Schaeffer Memorial Baptist Church still stand at 570 High Street in Christiansburg.
                A new era for the Christiansburg Institute began in 1896 when Booker T. Washington, founder of Tuskegee Institute, became adviser to CI. The Christiansburg Institute implemented a curriculum similar to those at Tuskegee and Hampton Institutes. The Institute continued to grow throughout the early twentieth century, expanding to property at 140 Scattergood Drive, where the 1927 Edgar A. Long Building, named for the principal of the Institute from 1906-1924, still stands. In 1947, the Friends’ Freedmen’s Associations deeded the Institute to the Montgomery County, Radford, and Pulaski County school systems. During the years of segregation in Southwest Virginia, the Institute served the educational needs of African American students from up to fifteen counties at a time. Christiansburg Institute closed in 1966 when local public schools integrated.</string>

	<key>Christiansburg Presbyterian Church</key>
	<array>
		<string>Oldest continually active church in Christiansburg, built 1853. 
Outer doors leading to the gallery were originally designed for slave use. 
Confederate general J. E. B. Stuart’s brother-in-law, Nicholas Chevalier, built the church and served as pastor before the Civil War.</string>
		<string>The Presbyterian Church is the oldest continually active church in Christiansburg, dating to 1853. James E. Crush, along with James and Samuel Hickok, constructed the Greek Revival structure, referring to the design handbooks of influential Boston architect Asher Benjamin. Crush and his carpenters were from Fincastle, Botetourt County, where several similar churches survive. The church steeple was restored for the first time in 1995. One interesting feature of this antebellum church is the outside entrance to a gallery, built, it is thought, to allow slaves to attend services while remaining separate from the free congregation. There is no way to access the gallery from inside the church. The additions behind and to the right of the church date to 1906 and 1927, respectively.
                Next door to the church on the left is the Presbyterian Church Manse. Completed in 1876, this building served as the residence for Christiansburg’s Presbyterian ministers until 1969. It replaced the Pepper House, today the Montgomery Museum on South Pepper Street, which was the original Presbyterian manse. Both the current church and the original manse on Pepper Street owe their existence to Reverend Nicholas Chevalier, pastor from 1839-1856. In 1855, he commissioned Edward Beyer to paint a view of Christiansburg that now resides at the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond. Reverend Chevalier was also the brother-in-law of Confederate cavalry general J.E.B. Stuart, having married Stuart’s sister Bertha.</string>

	<key>Kentland Plantation</key>
	<array>
		<string>Once the largest plantation in Montgomery County and a supplier of meat to the Confederate Army. 
The manor house was built c. 1835, possibly by a former Hessian soldier, John Swope. 
Union forces encamped here for a few days after the Battle of Cloyd’s Mountain. 
Former slaves from the plantation established the Wake Forest community after emancipation. 
There is a marker erected by slave descendants near the site of the Kentland slave cemetery</string>
		<string>The manor house at Kentland was built sometime between 1820 and 1835 in the Federal style. Kentland is named for James Randal Kent and his descendants, although the plantation did not bear this name until after the Civil War. The land was originally known as Buchanan’s Bottom. The house is a two-story, five-bay structure. Family tradition holds that the architect of Kentland was a former Hessian soldier named John Swope. The bricks were made by hand by slaves. An original hexagonal smokehouse and several later farm buildings still stand on the property, which is owned today by Virginia Tech and used as the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Farm.
                Kent’s plantation was the largest and most prosperous in Montgomery County on the eve of the Civil War. Over 120 slaves worked the farm, and James Randal Kent may have owned as many as 300 on all his properties combined. The Kent family property around Buchanan’s Bottom alone totaled 5,850 acres. When Virginia seceded in 1861, James Randal Kent, already a major in the local militia, helped organize Confederate troops and contracted to supply meat and other food to the new Confederate Army. Kentland, along with other Montgomery County plantations, was the target of an alleged 1861 plot by local unionists to foment a slave insurrection.
                The war reached Kentland in May 1864, when General George Crook’s Yankee soldiers appeared at the plantation following the Battle of Cloyd’s Mountain. For several days, Federal troops camped on the Kent property, destroying the meat destined for Confederate soldiers and the family table. The soldiers also burned some outbuildings and would have burned the manor house had James Randal Kent not refused to leave.</string>

	<key>Montgomery County Confederate Monument</key>
	<array>
		<string>Erected 1883 by the Montgomery County Ladies’ Memorial Association. 
The monument is a fifteen-foot high obelisk, dedicated to the county’s Confederate dead.</string>
		<string>Monuments to Confederate soldiers abound in counties and cities across Virginia. Montgomery County is no exception. The Montgomery Confederate monument stands on the corner of Main Street and Franklin Street in the town square of Christiansburg, Montgomery’s county seat. It is located across the street from the site of the old courthouse and in front of the Christiansburg post office.
                The monument is a modest obelisk, erected in 1883 by the Montgomery County Ladies’ Memorial Association to honor local Confederate soldiers. It is dedicated “to the memory of Montgomery’s sons who fell in the Lost Cause and to all the Confederate dead who lie beneath her soil.” Unlike the monument at Montgomery White Sulphur Springs, which was erected at the site of the Confederate hospital, Christiansburg’s monument commemorates not a specific site, but the sacrifices of Montgomery County soldiers in general.
                Christiansburg’s Confederate monument stands fifteen feet high and is made of granite. Its position on the town square reflects the historic importance of the old Montgomery County courthouse, which stood at the center of town. Confederate monuments were often placed near courthouses at the symbolic and often geographical center of the county. Other Confederate monuments in Montgomery County are located at Montgomery White Sulphur Springs and Westview Cemetery in Blacksburg.</string>

	<key>Montague House</key>
	<array>
		<string>Built c. 1790s, one of the oldest homes in Christiansburg. 
Used as headquarters by U.S. general George B. Stoneman when his cavalry raiders passed through Christiansburg in April 1865. 
Confederate generals Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson and J. E. B. Stuart are rumored to have stayed here. </string>
		<string>This home was built sometime between the 1780s and 1812. The portion to the left of the front door is an early log structure, expanded and covered with wood siding by nineteenth-century occupants. It is often referred to as the Montague-Crush House after two longtime resident families. Rice D. Montague purchased the house in 1825. Before that, it was known as “Morrison’s red house,” giving a hint of the original home’s color. The Montague family owned the house for over a century before Judge Charles W. Crush bought it in 1938. Confederate Generals Stonewall Jackson and J. E. B. Stuart may have stayed in this house during the Civil War. Union general George B. Stoneman headquartered here in April 1865 when his troops occupied Christiansburg. Stoneman’s raiders, tasked with destroying the essential Virginia and Tennessee Railroad in Southwest Virginia, reached Christiansburg the night of April 4 after marching north from Jacksonville (Floyd). Stoneman’s cavalry first heard the news of the fall of Richmond while encamped in Christiansburg.</string>

	<key>Montgomery White Sulphur Springs</key>
	<array>
		<string>Hot springs resort incorporated in 1855. 
Used as a Confederate general hospital during the Civil War. 
Confederate monument erected 1889 is only remnant of the once-thriving resort, which closed in 1904. 
265 Confederate soldiers are buried on the resort property.</string>
		<string>In the nineteenth century, Montgomery County was a holiday destination thanks to several hot springs resorts. One of the largest was Montgomery White Sulphur Springs, incorporated in 1855. The Virginia-Tennessee Railroad brought guests from Lynchburg to the small station at Big Tunnel (Montgomery). From there, passengers rode cars propelled by gravity down to the resort. The idyllic vacation spot was transformed by the Civil War. From 1862 to 1865, Montgomery White Sulphur Springs operated as a Confederate general hospital under Dr. J. Lewis Woodville, chief surgeon.
                At its peak, Montgomery White accommodated up to 700 sick, wounded, and recovering Confederate soldiers. Space at the hospital was so limited at times that soldiers had to sleep in the bowling alley. Among the employees treating the troops and running the hospital were slaves and Catholic nuns from Charleston, South Carolina.
                At least 265 Confederate soldiers died and were buried at Montgomery White Sulphur Springs during its time as a hospital. Although Union troops passed through the area in the last years of the war, the hospital was not disturbed. There were, however, sixty Federal soldiers recovering at the hospital when the Civil War ended.
                Today, the soldiers’ cemetery, along with the slave cemetery and what is known as the nuns’ cemetery are inaccessible to the public. The last remaining vestige of Montgomery White Sulphur Springs is the monument erected to honor the Confederate dead in 1889. Originally located on the main concourse at the resort during its heyday in the late nineteenth century, the monument was moved to its current location on the &quot;Devil&apos;s Armchair&quot; close to Den Hill Road in 1949, forty-five years after the resort closed its doors and reverted to farmland. One resort hotel from Montgomery County’s past remains at Yellow Sulphur Springs, home to a modern health spa and located at 3145 Yellow Sulphur Road, between Blacksburg and Christiansburg</string>

	<key>Battle of New River Bridge</key>
	<array>
		<string>Battle of New River Bridge (Radford) fought on May 10, 1864. 
The bridge was a weak point of the vital Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. 
Union forces set fire to and destroyed the bridge. </string>
		<string>After the Confederate defeat at the battle of Cloyd’s Mountain on May 9, 1864, Union forces under the command of General George Crook moved toward Central Depot to burn the 700-foot covered wooden railroad bridge spanning the New River. This bridge was the main target of the attacking Union forces. It had long been a Union objective, since it was the weakest point along the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. As the Federal forces approached the long bridge, the outnumbered Confederates withdrew across the New River after destroying some heavy guns—in order to defend the bridge and Central Depot from the opposite bank. The Confederates were able to take several smaller artillery pieces with them and an artillery duel raged across the river for several hours. Union soldiers placed several rail cars loaded with hay inside of the covered bridge and prepared to set fire to it. Captain Michael Egan of the 15th West Virginia Infantry Regiment swam out, climbed the bridge piers, amind the artillery duel, and set the bridge on fire.  As the bridge fell into the New River, the regimental band for the 23rd Ohio Infantry struck up a tune to celebrate the Union victory. This was a major setback for the Confederacy, as the bridge, a major supply artery for the Army of Northern Virginia, was out of commission for several weeks.</string>

	<key>Pearisburg</key>
	<array>
		<string>Occupied by Union soldiers from May 6—May 10, 1862. 
Future US Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley both fought in the Battle of Pearisburg. 
The 1836 courthouse was used as a barracks and hospital. 
Union headquarters was established in the small office at the 1829 Johnston House (Giles County Historical Society).</string>
		<string>Pearisburg is the seat of Giles County. The Civil War came to this small town on May 6, 1862, when Union troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes arrived from Princeton, West Virginia. The Federal soldiers took the town quickly, capturing several Confederate officers and soldiers and a large quantity of Confederate commissary supplies. The town was so small that some Union troops had to sleep in the courthouse (built 1836). Lt. Col. Hayes used Dr. Harvey Green Johnston’s small office as his headquarters. The office, built in 1857, still stands on the grounds of the Andrew Johnston House, built in 1829 and now home to the Giles County Historical Society. During the Federal occupation of Pearisburg, Hayes and his officers most likely stayed at the Woodrum Hotel on Main Street (no longer standing).
                The Federal hold on Pearisburg was tentative and did not last. Reinforcements were ordered to the town on May 9. Confederate forces under Brigadier General Henry Heth began their march that same night and reached Pearisburg from the south early on the morning of May 10. Outnumbered, Hayes ordered a retreat and Confederate soldiers followed Union troops as they drew back north along Main Street. Retreating Federal soldiers set fire to the Presbyterian Church across the street from the Johnston House, hoping to destroy the captured supplies they had stored there. According to local tradition, the soldier guarding the burning church was shot dead and the church saved by Pearisburg’s citizens. After the Federal retreat, the courthouse was used as a hospital. Only two soldiers—one Union, one Confederate—were ever confirmed dead after the skirmish, though reports of greater casualties abounded. Five Unknown Confederate Dead are buried under a marker in Angel’s Rest Cemetery, down the street from the courthouse.
                The Battle of Pearisburg was significant because Heth’s Confederates stopped the Union advance into Southwest Virginia. The Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, the ultimate target of the Federal troops, was not destroyed until after the Battle of Cloyd’s Mountain in May 1864. The skirmish at Pearisburg is also interesting because two future United States Presidents took part in the fight: Lt. Col. Rutherford B. Hayes (President 1877-1881) and Commissary Sergeant William McKinley (President 1897-1901). </string>

	<key>Smithfield Plantation</key>
	<array>
		<string>Built in 1774, Smithfield was the center of a thriving slave plantation until the Civil War. 
Home of William Ballard Preston, the delegate who proposed Virginia’s ordinance of secession. </string>
		<string>Smithfield Plantation, adjoining the Virginia Tech campus, was built in 1774 as the home of William and Susanna Preston and their children. It is open to visitors as a plantation museum, and although it is primarily interpreted as an eighteenth-century home, it is also a significant site in the Civil War era history of Virginia.
                Smithfield’s most notable connection to Civil War history is William Ballard Preston, owner of Smithfield until his death in 1862. The grandson of William and Susanna Preston, “Ballard” was a lawyer and planter who was active in politics at the state and national levels, including as Secretary of the Navy. In 1861 he represented Montgomery County at the Virginia Secession Convention. Ballard joined the convention as a conditional unionist, and voted against secession on April 4, 1861. He proposed and led a mission from the convention to Abraham Lincoln, with the objective of ascertaining Lincoln’s intentions. However, by the time Ballard and his fellow delegates met with Lincoln, Fort Sumter was already under fire. Lincoln’s call for troops quickly followed. Upon his return to Richmond Ballard proposed the ordinance of secession which was approved by the convention on April 17, 1861. He went on to serve in the Confederate House and Senate until his death on November 16, 1862, at home at Smithfield.
                Smithfield, along with other Montgomery County plantations, was the target of an alleged 1861 plot by local unionists to foment a slave insurrection. </string>

		<string>Oldest building on the Virginia Tech campus. 
Home of Colonel Robert Taylor Preston during the Civil War era. 
Purchased in 1872 to help establish the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, forerunner of Virginia.</string>
		<string>The oldest building on the Virginia Tech campus, Solitude was built in its current configuration in 1851, around a much earlier log cabin structure, by Colonel Robert Taylor Preston. The son of Virginia Governor James P. Preston and grandson of William and Susanna Preston, founders of neighboring Smithfield Plantation, Robert Taylor Preston served as a Justice of the Peace in Montgomery County as well as in the local militia before the Civil War broke out in 1861. Once the war started, Preston gained an appointment in the Provisional Army of Virginia as a Colonel of Volunteers. In July 1861 he became the commanding officer of the 28th Virginia Infantry Regiment, with the rank of Colonel in the new Army of the Confederate States of America. When the unit was reorganized in April of the following year, he was replaced as Colonel and returned home to Solitude. He was instrumental in helping to maintain a local volunteer militia force, and on May 13, 1863, he called for the men of Montgomery and Roanoke Counties to help defend against invading Union forces in the New River Valley. Some of these men had already taken part in the battle of Cloyd’s Mountain and the defense of local targets of the Union army. In August 1864, Preston was appointed Lieutenant Colonel, and later Colonel, of the 4th Virginia Reserves. These troops went on to defend Saltville against Union raiding parties. Several of the men under the command of Colonel Preston surrendered with the army under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston at Bennett Place, North Carolina, outside of Durham on April 26, 1865. After the war, Preston decided to sell Solitude for the sum of $21,000. Thanks to the Morrill Land Grant College Act of 1862, the Commonwealth of Virginia was able to purchase the property in order to establish the new Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1872. </string>
